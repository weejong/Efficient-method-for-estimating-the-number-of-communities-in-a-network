# Efficient-method-for-estimating-the-number-of-communities-in-a-network
This is a matlab version of the method which is proposed in "Efficient method for estimating the number of communities in a network" 
the link of the paper: https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.032310
I have tested the code in matlabR2010a and matlabr2017b
Here is a C version of the code : http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/
I just simply convert the c version to the matlab version.
